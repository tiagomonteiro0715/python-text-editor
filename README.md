The motivation behind this project was to gain a better understanding of python and its build-in library: tkinder. 

It is nothing more than a text editor. Inspired from a youtube video below. It has as caracteritis: _______,________,_______.

Not only I lerned alot about this framework, but also learned in a pratical way machine lerning. This projects standout by the code being writeen in a way that is easy to understand. And also creates a model that is easy and intuitive  to use. 

Thanks to this project, I understood better the tkinder library and GUI application as a whole. This project is somewhat different, because the code is truly simple to understand.
